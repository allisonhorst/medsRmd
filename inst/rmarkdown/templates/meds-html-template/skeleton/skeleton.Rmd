### Here is a Level 3 header

-   Bullet
-   Points

Here is what `code formatting will look like`.

Or, for a chunk:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Some comments
avg_mpg <- mean(mtcars$mpg)
max_mpg <- max(mtcars$mpg)
```

Here is a block quote:

> "The purpose of this block quote is to show you what it looks like using this theme."

# And another Level 1 header

An example ggplot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Car weight (tons)",
       y = "Gas mileage (mpg)",
       title = "Car weight and gas mileage") +
  theme_meds()
```
